# pH-Mouse
## pH-Mouse, or Probability Heat Mouse is a graphical representation for maze traversal probabilities.  
## Created by Tanner Lee with Julia 1.0 leveraging Luxor and ColorSchemes

### What is pH-Mouse?  
pH-Mouse is an overly complicated solution to a very simple programming assignment.  The assignment was to represent a mouse in a maze searching for cheese. This was supposed to be modeled with a probability matrix given an initial input vector.  To accomplish this with a Julia terminal is rather remedial, so to entertain myself and to further my knowledge of Julia I created pH-Mouse.  pH-Mouse (or Probability Heat Mouse or pHM) is a tool that takes an input of text maze and a starting location to create a .gif of the maze with a probability heatmap imposed over the top.  The heatmap is generated by observing the probability matrix at each iteration and assigning a specific color to its cell based on its relative "heat".  

### How to use pH-Mouse
Generating heatmaps with pH-Mouse is rather straightforward.  The following steps offer a walkthrough of the process:  
1. Create an Input File
  - An input file is simply a text based representation of the maze you'll like to represent.  
  - Rooms are separated by a space
  - Each room should be given as a string 
    - #P represents a pathway
    - #W represents a wall
    - #C represents the "cheese" or end-goal of the maze
  - Two example inputs are provided with the repository 
2. Install Julia Packages
  - pH-Mouse requires three different julia packages to function correctly
    - Luxor
    - Colors
    - ColorSchemes
   - Install each package by entering the following command in a Julia terminal
    - `] add Luxor, Colors, ColorSchemes`
4. Install FFmpeg
  - pH-Mouse requires ffmpeg to compile its images into a .gif file
  - FFmpeg installation is explained extremely well by [adaptlearning](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-FFmpeg)
3. Execute pH-Mouse
  - pH-Mouse can be executed by Julia from the terminal with the following command:
    - `julia pHM.jl`
    - Note: Julia must be added to your PATH enviroment variable for this to function properly
4. Set Runtime Preferences
  - When launching pH-Mouse, you'll first be asked to enter a series of preferences for execution
  - These preferences are as follows:
    - `Which input number would you like to load?`
      - This specifies which input file to use
      - `1` would specify input1.phm for the simulation
    - `How many iterations would you like to run?`
      - This specifies how many times the probability matrix should be evaluated
      - `250` would specify 250 multiplications of the matrix
    - `Which room would you like to start in?`
      - This specifies which room the simulation should pass as an input to the matrix
      - `5` would specify room 5P as the starting room
    - `Enter an intensity for the heatmap {1-10}`
      - This specifies the intensity of the colors used by the simulation
      - For larger matrices, higher values will make the iterations easier to see
      - `10` would specify a very bright, intense heatmap
### Files and Folders generated by pH-Mouse
pH-Mouse will generate several different files and an additional folder on your machine at runtime.  These files and folders are as follows:
- ./tmp folder
  - This folder is used to store the temporary images files used by FFmpeg when generating the .gif.  
  - The contents of this folder can be deleted after runtime
    - NOTE: This folder and its files are not deleted automatically by pH-Mouse after runtime because they offer an excellent step by step visualization of the probability matrix
- ./tmp/*.png
  - These files are the temporary image files used by FFmpeg to when generating the .gif.
- ./images/pHM.gif
  - This file is the output of pH-Mouse
  - It is a .gif that shows the complete heatmap output of the probability manipulation for the maze.

### Some Questions to Consider 
Each of the gifs can be used to answer several questions.  Consider the following:
1. Is there any room that the mouse seems to want to stay in/near?
  - Since all rooms have an equal probability to be entered/exited (except the room with the cheese), there's not much tendency for the mouse to get caught in any one room for too long.  
2. Is there a best starting room for the mouse to find the cheese?  Is there a worst room?
  - The best starting room to find the cheese will always be the room immediately next to the cheese room.  As for a worst room, each maze's worst room can be found by traversing as many squares away from the cheese as possible.  
3. What are transition vectors for 10 multiplications for each room?
  - Attached below is an image generated from the 10th multiplication of the transition matrix, where one mouse was placed in each room at the start.

4. How would we be able to tell if there was larning happening by using real mice?
  - We could tell if a real mouse was learning by repeating traversal of the same maze several times.  As the mouse enters successive runs of the maze, its path should deviate significantly from the expected paths shown by pH-Mouse.  If a mouse were to continue to replicate the results of this program's output, it certainly would not be learning.
